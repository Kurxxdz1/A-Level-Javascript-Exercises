# Exercise 1a — Stack Array (Easy)

Goal: Complete the small number of blanks in `script.js` so that `push` and `pop` behave correctly.

What to edit:
- `script.js` — look for `// TODO` comments and `___________` blanks.

Hints:
- `push` should place the value at the new top index.
- `pop` should clear that position and return the removed value.

Marking:
- Correct value returned by `push` (the new top) and by `pop` (the popped value).
