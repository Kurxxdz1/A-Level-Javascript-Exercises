# Exercise 1c — Stack Array (Hard)

Goal: Fill in all the blanks to implement the push and pop operations correctly, including edge cases.

What to edit:
- `script.js` — many blanks need correct JS expressions and statements.

Hints:
- Carefully consider what should happen when `top` is updated and when the stack is full/empty.
- Test your solution by running the page and using the UI if available.
