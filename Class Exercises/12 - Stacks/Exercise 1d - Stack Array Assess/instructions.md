# Exercise 1d — Stack Array (Assess)

Assessment: Implement `push` and `pop` from scratch in `script.js`. No scaffolding is provided — show full, working implementations.

Success criteria:
- `push` returns `-1` when full, otherwise the new top index.
- `pop` returns `-1` when empty, otherwise the popped value.

Teacher notes: Use this for assessment; students should not be shown the solution.
