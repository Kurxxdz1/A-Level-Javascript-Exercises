# Exercise 2a — Stack Class (Easy)

Goal: Fill in a small number of blanks in `script.js` so that `push` and `pop` work for the class-based stack.

What to edit:
- `script.js` — look for `___________` and `// TODO` comments.

Hints:
- `push` should create a new `Node` with the given value and put it at the top.
- `pop` should remove the top node, update `top`, and return the removed value.
