# Exercise 2 Example - Stack with Class and Nodes

This example demonstrates a stack implemented using a class and linked nodes.

- **Push:** Add a value to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Remove and return the top value from the stack.
- **Peek:** View the top value without removing it.
- **Clear:** Remove all values from the stack.

Try pushing, popping, and peeking values to see how the stack changes. The top of the stack is shown on the left.
