# Exercise 1b — Stack Array (Medium)

Goal: Complete the blanks in `script.js` to correctly handle stack overflow and underflow and implement push/pop.

What to edit:
- `script.js` — fill the blanks marked with `___________`.

Hints:
- Remember to update `top` and `stack[top]` correctly.
- `push` should return `-1` when the stack is full and the new top when successful.
- `pop` should return `-1` when empty and the popped value otherwise.
